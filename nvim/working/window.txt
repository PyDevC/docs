A window is a viewport onto a buffer.
one buffer can be viewed on multiple windows or several window viewing differnt
buffers.

each window has a window ID. ID doesnot change within a session.
win_getid() and win_id2tabwin() functions can be used to convert between the
window number and the identifier.

Window number changes whenever the windows are opened or closed. winnr()

If wrap is off then the part that only fits the window is shown.
All normal ASCII characters are diplayed on screen. <Tab> is replaced by number
of spaces that it represents. Other non-printing characters are ^char which is
64 added to 7. 
ex: ascii 7 is replaced by ^G. ^{71}.

The name Vim and the full name of the current file name will be shown in the
title bar.  When the window is resized, Vim will automatically redraw the
window.  You may make the window as small as you like, but if it gets too
small not a single line will fit in it.  Make it at least 40 characters wide
to be able to read most messages on the last line.

windows are kept in a tree of frames.
