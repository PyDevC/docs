API client 
All external UIs and remote plugins (as opposed to regular Vim plugins) are
"clients" in general; but we call something an "API client" if its purpose is
to abstract or wrap the RPC API for the convenience of other applications
(just like a REST client or SDK such as boto3 for AWS: you can speak AWS REST
using an HTTP client like curl, but boto3 wraps that in a convenient python
interface). For example, the Nvim lua-client is an API client:
    https://github.com/neovim/lua-client


Host 
A plugin "host" is both a client (of the Nvim API) and a server (of an
external platform, e.g. python). It is a remote plugin that hosts other
plugins.


Remote plugin
Arbitrary code registered via :UpdateRemotePlugins, that runs in a separate
process and communicates with Nvim via the api.
